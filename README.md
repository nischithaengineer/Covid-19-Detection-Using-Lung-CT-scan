# Covid-19-Detection-Using-Lung-CT-scan

1.Overview:
This project aims to detect COVID-19 using lung CT scans through a web application built with Flask. The application allows users to upload CT scan images for analysis, leveraging a pre-trained machine learning model to identify potential COVID-19 indicators.

2. Features:
* Upload CT Scans: Users can upload their lung CT scan images through the web interface.
* Automated Detection: Upon upload, the application utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze the images for potential COVID-19 indicators.
* Result Display: The results of the analysis are displayed to the user, indicating the likelihood of COVID-19 presence based on the CT scan.
